Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This is a useful project for developing skill with getting and cleaning data as a whole. 
The primary objectives are to create a script from the given data set, the "Human Activity 
Recognition Using Smartphones" data set, satisfying the following conditions:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average 
   of each variable for each activity and each subject.
   
All of these goals are satisfied with the script provided and through exposure to skillful
data manipulation. Successive steps rearranged the data into tidier and tidier forms that 
provided for practical summarizations.
